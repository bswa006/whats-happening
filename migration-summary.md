# Figma to Code Migration Summary

## Overview

I migrated the "Enter Phone" screen from Figma to a Next.js React implementation following the guidance in the figma-to-code-migration-guide.md document.

## Components Created

### 1. PhoneInput Component

- Created a reusable phone input component with country code prefix
- Extracted exact styling values from Figma (border radius, height, padding, font styles)
- Incorporated the Indian flag SVG from the Figma design
- Implemented proper input validation for phone numbers

### 2. Button Component

- Created a reusable button component with multiple variants
- Matched the Figma design's orange primary color (#F7791E)
- Implemented the exact shadow effect (6px 4px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1))
- Used the correct font styles and padding from Figma

### 3. EnterPhone Page

- Implemented the complete page layout matching the Figma design
- Incorporated the food illustration background image
- Created the pixel-perfect layout with exact spacing and alignment
- Added the terms and conditions text with proper styling

## Assets Used

- Downloaded the Indian flag SVG from Figma
- Downloaded the food illustration background image from Figma
- Placed these assets in the appropriate public directory

## Design Token Implementation

- Utilized the existing Tailwind CSS configuration
- Confirmed that the color tokens, shadows, border radius, and typography matched the Figma design

## Adherence to Migration Guide

The implementation followed the guide's recommendations for:

- Extracting exact values from Figma Dev Mode
- Managing assets appropriately
- Creating pixel-perfect components
- Using proper fonts and styling
- Handling layout and responsive behavior

## Next Steps

To complete the authentication flow, we need to implement:

1. The OTP verification screen
2. API integration for sending and verifying OTPs
3. Navigation between authentication steps
4. User profile storage and management
